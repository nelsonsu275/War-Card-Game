War Card Game Project (2 Player Simulation)
- War Card Game is programmed using python.
Rules:
- A deck of cards is shuffled and split into two halves for each player.
- Each card will have a rank in this ascending order: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A
- All suits are disregarded in this game.
- Each turn, both players will draw a card. The higher rank will win the round and insert
  both cards under their deck.
- If both cards drawn are the same rank, a war will begin. Once a war begins, both players
  draw 3 cards face down. Then, they'll drawn another card to compare. The higher rank of this
  card will win the round and claim both original cards, all face down cards, and the determining
  war card. If the war card continues to be the same rank, war will begin again and repeat the 
  same process.
- If at any time a player runs out of cards, that player will lose the game. The other player
  with cards remaining wins the game of War.
